"""Iterator wrapper for checking wrapped iterator's emptiness or plurality."""

# TODO: Here and elsewhere (wildcard_iterator, name_expansion), do not reference
# __iter__ directly because it causes the first element to be instantiated.
# Instead, implement __iter__ as a return self and implement the next() function
# which returns (not yields) the values.  This necessitates that in the case
# of the iterator classes, the iterator is used once per class instantiation
# so that next() calls do not collide, but this semantic has been long-assumed
# by the iterator classes for the use of __iter__ anyway.
