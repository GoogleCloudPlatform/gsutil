_DETAILED_HELP_TEXT = ("""
<B>OVERVIEW</B>
  Cloud SDK includes a new CLI, gcloud storage, that can be considerably faster
  than gsutil when performing uploads and downloads with less parameter
  tweaking. This new CLI has a syntax and command structure that is familiar to
  gsutil users but is fundamentally different in many important ways. To ease
  transition to this new CLI, gsutil provides a shim that translates your gsutil
  commands to gcloud storage commands if an equivalent exists, and falls back to
  gsutil's usual behavior if an equivalent does not exist.


<B>TO ENABLE</B>
  Set ``use_gcloud_storage=True`` in the ``.boto`` config file under the
  ``[GSUtil]`` section:

    [GSUtil]
    use_gcloud_storage=True

  You can also set the flag for individual commands using the top-level ``-o``
  flag:

    gsutil -o "GSUtil:use_gcloud_storage=True" -m cp -p file gs://bucket/obj

<B>AVAILABLE COMMANDS</B>
  The gcloud storage CLI only supports a subset of gsutil commands. What follows
  is a list of commands supported by the shim with any differences in behavior
  noted.

  cat
  ------------------------

  - Prints object data for a second object even if the first object is invalid.

  compose
  ------------------------

  - Works as expected.

  cp
  ------------------------

  - Copies a second object even if the first object is invalid.
  - Does not support file to file copies.
  - Supports copying objects cloud-to-cloud with trailing slashes in the name.
  - The all-version flag (``-A``) silently enables sequential execution rather
    than raising an error.

  defstorageclass
  ------------------------

  - Works as expected.

  kms
  ------------------------

  - The authorize subcommand returns informational messages in a different
    format.
  - The encryption subcommand returns informational messages in a different
    format.

  logging
  ------------------------

  - The get subcommand has different JSON spacing and doesn't print an
    informational message if no configuration is found.

  ls
  ------------------------

  - Works as expected.

  mb
  ------------------------
  - Works as expected.

  mv
  ------------------------

  - See notes on cp.

  notification
  ------------------------

  - The list subcommand prints configuration information as YAML.
  - The delete subcommand offers progress tracking and parallelization.

  pap
  ------------------------

  - Works as expected.

  rb
  ------------------------

  - Works as expected.

  requesterpays
  ------------------------

  - Works as expected.

  rewrite
  ------------------------

  - The -k flag does not throw an error if called without a new key. In both the
    shim and unshimmed cases, the old key is maintained.

  rm
  ------------------------

  - ``$folder$`` delete markers are not supported.

  setmeta
  ------------------------

  - Does not throw an error if no headers are changed.

  stat
  ------------------------

  - Includes a field "Storage class update time:" which may throw off tabbing.

  versioning
  ------------------------

  - Works as expected.

  web
  ------------------------

  - The get subcommand has different JSON spacing and doesn't print an
    informational message if no configuration is found.



<B>BOTO CONFIGURATION</B>

  variables where appropriate.

  - client_secret: CLOUDSDK_AUTH_CLIENT_SECRET
  - provider_authorization_uri: CLOUDSDK_AUTH_AUTH_HOST
  - provider_token_uri: CLOUDSDK_AUTH_TOKEN_HOST

<B>GENERAL COMPATIBILITY NOTES</B>

  - Due to its compatibility across all major platforms, multiprocessing is
    enabled for all commands by default (equivalent to the -m option always
    being included in gsutil).
  - A sequence of asterisks greater than 2 (i.e. ``***``) are always treated as
    a single asterisk.
  - Unlike gsutil, gcloud is not designed to be used in parallel invocations,
    and doing so (i.e. running the shim from 2 terminals at once) can lead to
    unpredictable behavior.
  - Assuming a bucket contains an object ``gs://bucket/nested/foo.txt``,
    gsutil's wildcard iterator will match ``foo.txt`` given a URL like
    ``gs://bucket/*/nested/*``. The shim will not match ``foo.txt`` given the
    same URL.
  - This will be updated as new commands are supported by both gcloud storage
    and the shim.
