<B>OVERVIEW</B>
  gsutil currently supports four types of credentials/authentication, as well as
  the ability to access public data anonymously (see "gsutil help anon" for more
  on anonymous access).

  Note that when using the JSON API (which is the default behavior), you can
  configure at most one of the following types of GCS credentials in a single
  boto config file: OAuth2 User Account, OAuth2 Service Account, and
  GCE Internal Service Account. You may have also S3 HMAC credentials, in
  addition to the GCS credentials. This would be necessary for using s3:// URLs.

  OAuth2 User Account:
    This is the preferred type of credentials for authenticating requests on
    behalf of a specific user (which is probably the most common use of gsutil).
    This is the default type of credential that will be created when you run
    "gsutil config".
    For more details about OAuth2 authentication, see:
    https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2#scenarios

  HMAC:
    This type of credential can be used by programs that are implemented using
    HMAC authentication, which is an authentication mechanism supported by
    certain other cloud storage service providers. This type of credential can
    also be used for interactive use when moving data to/from service providers
    that support HMAC credentials. This is the type of credential that will be
    created when you run "gsutil config -a".

    Note that it's possible to set up HMAC credentials for both Google Cloud
    Storage and another service provider; or to set up OAuth2 user account
    credentials for Google Cloud Storage and HMAC credentials for another
    service provider. To do so, after you run the gsutil config command, you
    can edit the generated ~/.boto config file and look for comments for where
    other credentials can be added.

    For more details about HMAC authentication, see:
      https://developers.google.com/storage/docs/reference/v1/getting-startedv1#keys

  OAuth2 Service Account:
    This is the preferred type of credential to use when authenticating on
    behalf of a service or application (as opposed to a user). For example, if
    you will run gsutil out of a nightly cron job to upload/download data,
    using a service account allows the cron job not to depend on credentials of
    an individual employee at your company. This is the type of credential that
    will be configured when you run "gsutil config -e".

    It is important to note that a service account is considered an Editor by
    default for the purposes of API access, rather than an Owner. In particular,
    the fact that Editors have OWNER access in the default object and
    bucket ACLs, but the canned ACL options remove OWNER access from
    Editors, can lead to unexpected results. The solution to this problem is to
    add the email address for your service account as a project Owner. To find
    the email address, visit the
    `Google Developers Console <https://cloud.google.com/console#/project>`_,
    click on the project you're using, click "APIs & auth", and click
    "Credentials".

    To create a service account, visit the Google Cloud Console and then:

       - Click the APIs tab on the left

       - Click "APIs & auth"

       - Click the red "Create New Client ID" button

       - Create a "Service Account" type

       - Save the private key and password provided.

    For further information about account roles, see:
      https://developers.google.com/console/help/#DifferentRoles

    For more details about OAuth2 service accounts, see:
      https://developers.google.com/accounts/docs/OAuth2ServiceAccount

  GCE Internal Service Account:
    This is the type of service account used for accounts hosted by App Engine
    or GCE. Such credentials are created automatically for you on GCE when you
    run the gcutil addinstance command with the --service_account flag.

    For more details about GCE service accounts, see:
      https://developers.google.com/compute/docs/authentication;

    For more details about App Engine service accounts, see:
      https://developers.google.com/appengine/docs/python/appidentity/overview
