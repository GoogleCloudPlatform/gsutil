<B>OVERVIEW</B>
  gsutil users can access publicly readable data without obtaining
  credentials. For example, the gs://uspto-pair bucket contains a number
  of publicly readable objects, so any user can run the following command
  without first obtaining credentials:

    gsutil ls gs://uspto-pair/applications/0800401*

  Users can similarly download objects they find via the above gsutil ls
  command.

  If a user without credentials attempts to access protected data using gsutil,
  they will be prompted to run "gsutil config" to obtain credentials.

  See "gsutil help acls" for more details about data protection.
