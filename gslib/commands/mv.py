<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
  gsutil mv [-p] src_url dst_url
  gsutil mv [-p] url... dst_url


<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
  The gsutil mv command allows you to move data between your local file
  system and the cloud, move data within the cloud, and move data between
  cloud storage providers. For example, to move all objects from a
  bucket to a local directory you could use:

    gsutil mv gs://my_bucket dir

  Similarly, to move all objects from a local directory to a bucket you could
  use:

    gsutil mv ./dir gs://my_bucket


<B>RENAMING BUCKET SUBDIRECTORIES</B>
  You can use the gsutil mv command to rename subdirectories. For example,
  the command:

    gsutil mv gs://my_bucket/olddir gs://my_bucket/newdir

  would rename all objects and subdirectories under gs://my_bucket/olddir to be
  under gs://my_bucket/newdir, otherwise preserving the subdirectory structure.

  If you do a rename as specified above and you want to preserve ACLs, you
  should use the -p option (see OPTIONS).

  Note that when using mv to rename bucket subdirectories you cannot specify
  the source URL using wildcards. You need to spell out the complete name:

    gsutil mv gs://my_bucket/olddir gs://my_bucket/newdir

  If you have a large number of files to move you might want to use the
  gsutil -m option, to perform a multi-threaded/multi-processing move:

    gsutil -m mv gs://my_bucket/olddir gs://my_bucket/newdir


<B>NON-ATOMIC OPERATION</B>
  Unlike the case with many file systems, the gsutil mv command does not
  perform a single atomic operation. Rather, it performs a copy from source
  to destination followed by removing the source for each object.


<B>OPTIONS</B>
  All options that are available for the gsutil cp command are also available
  for the gsutil mv command (except for the -R flag, which is implied by the
  gsutil mv command). Please see the OPTIONS sections of "gsutil help cp"
  for more information.
