<B>SYNOPSIS</B>
  gsutil [-D] config [-a] [-b] [-f] [-o <file>] [-r] [-s <scope>] [-w]


<B>DESCRIPTION</B>
  The gsutil config command obtains access credentials for Google Cloud
  Storage and writes a boto/gsutil configuration file containing the obtained
  credentials along with a number of other configuration-controllable values.

  Unless specified otherwise (see OPTIONS), the configuration file is written
  to ~/.boto (i.e., the file .boto under the user's home directory). If the
  default file already exists, an attempt is made to rename the existing file
  to ~/.boto.bak; if that attempt fails the command will exit. A different
  destination file can be specified with the -o option (see OPTIONS).

  Because the boto configuration file contains your credentials you should
  keep its file permissions set so no one but you has read access. (The file
  is created read-only when you run gsutil config.)


<B>CREDENTIALS</B>
  By default gsutil config obtains OAuth2 credentials, and writes them
  to the [Credentials] section of the configuration file. The -r, -w,
  -f options (see OPTIONS below) cause gsutil config to request a token
  with restricted scope; the resulting token will be restricted to read-only
  operations, read-write operation, or all operations (including getacl/setacl/
  getdefacl/setdefacl/disablelogging/enablelogging/getlogging operations). In
  addition, -s <scope> can be used to request additional (non-Google-Storage)
  scopes.

  If you want to use credentials based on access key and secret (the older
  authentication method before OAuth2 was supported) instead of OAuth2,
  see help about the -a option in the OPTIONS section.

  If you wish to use gsutil with other providers (or to copy data back and
  forth between multiple providers) you can edit their credentials into the
  [Credentials] section after creating the initial configuration file.


<B>CONFIGURATION FILE SELECTION PROCEDURE</B>
  By default, gsutil will look for the configuration file in /etc/boto.cfg and
  ~/.boto. You can override this choice by setting the BOTO_CONFIG environment
  variable. This is also useful if you have several different identities or
  cloud storage environments: By setting up the credentials and any additional
  configuration in separate files for each, you can switch environments by
  changing environment variables.

  You can also set up a path of configuration files, by setting the BOTO_PATH
  environment variable to contain a ":" delimited path. For example setting
  the BOTO_PATH environment variable to:

    /etc/projects/my_group_project.boto.cfg:/home/mylogin/.boto

  will cause gsutil to load each configuration file found in the path in
  order. This is useful if you want to set up some shared configuration
  state among many users: The shared state can go in the central shared file
  ( /etc/projects/my_group_project.boto.cfg) and each user's individual
  credentials can be placed in the configuration file in each of their home
  directories. (For security reasons users should never share credentials
  via a shared configuration file.)


<B>CONFIGURATION FILE STRUCTURE</B>
  The configuration file contains a number of sections: [Credentials],
  [Boto], [GSUtil], and [OAuth2]. If you edit the file make sure to edit the
  appropriate section (discussed below), and to be careful not to mis-edit
  any of the setting names (like "gs_access_key_id") and not to remove the
  section delimiters (like "[Credentials]").


<B>ADDITIONAL CONFIGURATION-CONTROLLABLE FEATURES</B>
  With the exception of setting up gsutil to work through a proxy (see
  below), most users won't need to edit values in the boto configuration file;
  values found in there tend to be of more specialized use than command line
  option-controllable features.

  The following are the currently defined configuration settings, broken
  down by section. Their use is documented in comments preceding each, in
  the configuration file. If you see a setting you want to change that's not
  listed in your current file, see the section below on Updating to the Latest
  Configuration File.

  The currently supported settings, are, by section:
  [Boto]
    proxy
    proxy_port
    proxy_user
    proxy_pass
    is_secure
    https_validate_certificates
    send_crlf_after_proxy_auth_headers
    debug
    num_retries

  [GSUtil]
    resumable_threshold
    resumable_tracker_dir
    parallel_process_count
    parallel_thread_count
    default_api_version
    default_project_id
    use_magicfile

  [OAuth2]
    token_cache
    token_cache
    client_id
    client_secret
    provider_label
    provider_authorization_uri
    provider_token_uri


<B>UPDATING TO THE LATEST CONFIGURATION FILE</B>
  We add new configuration controllable features to the boto configuration file
  over time, but most gsutil users create a configuration file once and then
  keep it for a long time, so new features aren't apparent when you update
  to a newer version of gsutil. If you want to get the latest configuration
  file (which includes all the latest settings and documentation about each)
  you can rename your current file (e.g., to '.boto_old'), run gsutil config,
  and then edit any configuration settings you wanted from your old file
  into the newly created file. Note, however, that if you're using OAuth2
  credentials and you go back through the OAuth2 configuration dialog it will
  invalidate your previous OAuth2 credentials.

  If no explicit scope option is given, -f (full control) is assumed by default.


<B>OPTIONS</B>
  -a          Prompt for Google Cloud Storage access key and secret (the older
              authentication method before OAuth2 was supported) instead of
              obtaining an OAuth2 token.

  -b          Causes gsutil config to launch a browser to obtain OAuth2 approval
              and the project ID instead of showing the URL for each and asking
              the user to open the browser. This will probably not work as
              expected if you are running gsutil from an ssh window, or using
              gsutil on Windows.

  -f          Request token with full-control access (default).

  -o <file>   Write the configuration to <file> instead of ~/.boto.
              Use '-' for stdout.

  -r          Request token restricted to read-only access.

  -s <scope>  Request additional OAuth2 <scope>.

  -w          Request token restricted to read-write access.
